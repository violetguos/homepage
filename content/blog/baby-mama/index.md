I remember watching Baby Mama when I was much younger and I had zero understanding of Kate’s struggle.

Kate is a career minded woman who’s chosen promotion over pregnancy. She tried donor sperm, in-vitro treatment, hormone injections, adoptions, all to no avail.

Now, pausing right here. I rewatched the move as a young female software engineer who has just joined the industry. The struggles are real. Most women quit their tech jobs because the companies do not accommodate [part time work](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/21/why-i-quit-facebook-to-become-a-mother.html) after they have children.

It is rumoured that SV grants female engineers insurance coverage for fertility treatment, egg freezing, etc. As a woman in tech, I can confirm the rumour is true.

It still seems like a cheap fix.

- Egg freezing and fertility treatment is [NOT a guaranteed success](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj1sMiC44HyAhVYa80KHW6_B1sQFjAAegQIBRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fwp%2F2018%2F01%2F27%2Ffeature%2Fshe-championed-the-idea-that-freezing-your-eggs-would-free-your-career-but-things-didnt-quite-work-out%2F&usg=AOvVaw0YzMM_UzgSeQ1tu7SUEIrb).
- Our biology is not like a Youtube video that you can [pause and hit repaly whenever we please](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/08/14/133377/mothers-journey-egg-freezing-parenthood/).
- The insurance policy is cheaper than revamping the entire dev cycle for all engineers to make PT work possible.

Although this movie has a very mediocre rating, it at least portrays the 21st century working women struggle on the screen and confronts very real issues head on. I haven’t come across any new release touching the same topics directly. Hollywood productions can’t solve this problem, but it still disappoints me that nobody’s even trying to write about the struggles of working women.
