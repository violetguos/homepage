          I am a machine learning engineer and a data scientist. I worked on challenging aspects of data science and machine learning, e.g.
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tackled data including audio, images, time series, health care data, natural languages, chemical molecules
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintained modular Python code with test suites (unit tests, integration, and coding style)
            </li>
            <li>
              Tackled challenging scenarios, such as datasets with few labels
            </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          I also build websites. It started as a hobby, but now I'm determined to become a full stack (Rails + JS) dev.
        </p>
          <p>
            I'm still learning front end dev. This website is based on a template designed and developed by <a href="https://github.com/berat/homepage" target="_blank">
              Berat Bozkurt
            </a>.
